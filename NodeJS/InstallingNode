Installing NodeJS:


On Windows:

1) Go to https://nodejs.org/en/
2) Go to Downloads
3) Click on Windows Installer
4) Follow the instructions of the installer

After the installation, go to your command prompt and type "node -v".
If it displays you the version of NodeJS then you have installed NodeJS correctly.

In case it does not work, restart your computer.


On Mac:

For Mac users, installation of NodeJS is different than Windows users.

Before installing NodeJS, you will need to have Homebrew on your computer.
Install it from the following link: http://brew.sh/

After installing Homebrew, go on your terminal and type the following "brew install node". It will install everything that you need for NodeJS.

Next, type "node -v" inside your terminal. If it displays you the version of NodeJS then you have installed NodeJS correctly.
