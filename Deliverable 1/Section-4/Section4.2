The web server that is used to stored the database is the WampServer64 2.5. The WAMP server , which is an accronym for Windows, Apache, MySQL and PHP, provides those programs for use. With the WampServer64 version 2.5, it will support the Apache : 2.4.9, the MySQL : 5.6.17, the PHP : 5.5.12, the PHPMyAdmin : 4.1.14, the SqlBuddy : 1.3.3, and the XDebug : 2.2.5. Also, the other softwares that are used to for the editing and reviewing the source documentations and codes are Google Docs/Drive and Microsoft word. Google Docs allows all teammembers to brainstorm and work together efficiently. Microsoft Word was used for more individual documentation and for greater flexibility in organizing documented information. GitHub was also used to control and update the source codes of the system. To facilitate communication between teammembers easier, Facebook, Slack and Skype are used for holding discussions and meetings.
In addition to the above programs laptops and desktops will be used to install and carry the WAMP database and other software that will be required for the project. The laptops are not of a uniform variety but instead come from a wide range of manufacturers. They are DELL, HP and MAC laptops and desktops. In addition to containing the above serve the laptops and desktops also contain React, a JavaScript software used to develop the front end of the final product.
In order to facilitate uniformity amongst team members the team laptops/desktops must have the following minimum requirements:
150 GB of memory
4 GB of RAM
Intel Premium 4 or AMD Athlon x64
WI-FI internet access
Windows 7/Linux operating systems
Headsets, earphones and speaker setups (to allow for discussions through skype)
All code and document files related to the project are sorted and stored on Github under the repository Schedule-Builder through the use of Github accounts. All team members have access to Github folders, files and their content. The programming languages which will be used are HTML, PHP, JavaScript and CSS.
